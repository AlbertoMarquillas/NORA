\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{1.5.5 Emotional Engine}

The Emotional Engine is a conceptual and software subsystem designed to simulate internal affective states within NORA. These emotional states influence both behavior and multimodal expressions, including lighting, posture, vocal tone, and movement patterns.

Rather than using pure randomness, NORA bases its emotional changes on external stimuli, user interaction patterns, and internal system metrics such as battery level or temperature.

\noindent\textbf{Emotional States (core set):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{NEUTRAL} – Default, idle state
    \item \texttt{CURIOUS} – Triggered by new input or sensory detection
    \item \texttt{HAPPY} – Positive feedback or social engagement
    \item \texttt{TIRED} – Low battery or long uptime
    \item \texttt{ALERT} – Motion detected or unexpected event
    \item \texttt{SAD} – Lack of interaction or shutdown request
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{State Transitions:}

Emotional state is updated through a weighted evaluation of inputs over time. A sample transition matrix:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Trigger} & \textbf{Current State} & \textbf{Next State} \\
\hline
No interaction for >10 min & NEUTRAL & SAD \\
User voice detected & NEUTRAL or SAD & HAPPY \\
New NFC tag detected & NEUTRAL & CURIOUS \\
Low battery warning & Any & TIRED \\
Movement in environment & Any & ALERT \\
Charging dock reached & TIRED & NEUTRAL \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent\textbf{Expression Outputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RGB Lighting:} Internal LED color or pulsing frequency
    \item \textbf{Voice Modulation:} Pitch and rhythm variation
    \item \textbf{Posture and Movement:} Tilting head, small motions
    \item \textbf{Facial Animation:} (optional) Display-based facial expressions
    \item \textbf{Log Entry:} Each emotional shift is stored in the system diary
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent\textbf{Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python module running as a background agent
    \item State stored in shared memory accessible by GUI and Voice modules
    \item Configurable thresholds and reaction profiles
    \item Exposes API for external modules to query or modify current state
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent\textbf{Interaction Example:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item FSM triggers event: `user\_speaks`
    \item Emotional engine updates state to \texttt{HAPPY}
    \item LED fades to warm yellow, speech becomes more energetic
    \item Diary logs: `14:23 — Detected friendly voice, changed state to HAPPY`
\end{itemize}
