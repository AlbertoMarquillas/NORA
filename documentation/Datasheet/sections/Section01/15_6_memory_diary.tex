\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{1.5.6 Memory and Diary System}

The Memory and Diary subsystem enables NORA to store meaningful user experiences, states, and interaction histories in a structured and revisitable manner. It combines contextual metadata, emotional state tracking, voice annotations, and timestamps to build an internal “life log” of its operation.

\noindent\textbf{Core Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory Logs:} Each relevant event (voice command, sensor detection, emotional shift) is logged with context.
    \item \textbf{Daily Diary:} Summarizes key events and emotional states per day.
    \item \textbf{Voice Notes:} Users can dictate messages to be stored as diary entries.
    \item \textbf{Markdown Export:} Textual entries can be exported to human-readable `.md` files.
    \item \textbf{NAS Integration:} All entries are saved within NORA's local NAS and accessible via GUI.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Event Format Example:}
\begin{verbatim}
2025-06-01 18:32 — [EVENT] NFC tag "MyKeys" detected
2025-06-01 18:33 — [EMOTION] Shifted to CURIOUS
2025-06-01 18:40 — [VOICE] "Remind me to call Alex tomorrow"
2025-06-01 18:41 — [DIARY] Entry created: "Reminder set: call Alex"
\end{verbatim}

    \item “Remember that the red folder belongs to math.”
    \item “Show me my diary from last week.”
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Data Organization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{/storage/diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md} — Text diary for each day
    \item \texttt{/storage/logs/emotions.log} — Chronological emotional states
    \item \texttt{/storage/voice-notes/YYYY-MM-DD\_hhmm.ogg} — Optional audio notes
    \item \texttt{/storage/reminders.json} — Persistent reminders/events
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent\textbf{Internal Architecture:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python-based logging daemon
    \item Receives input from FSM, Emotional Engine, Voice Module
    \item Automatically rotates and archives logs daily
    \item Provides REST endpoint for frontend visualization
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent\textbf{Access and Review:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Through GUI → "Diary" section (calendar + list view)
    \item By voice → "Show my memories from today"
    \item Remotely via NAS interface (read-only access)
\end{itemize}
