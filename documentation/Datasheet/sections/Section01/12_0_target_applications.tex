\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1.2 Target Applications}

NORA is designed as a versatile and modular embedded system suitable for a broad range of applications where localized intelligence, multimodal interaction, and deterministic behavior are required. The systemâ€™s internal modularity, open design, and local processing capabilities make it particularly well suited for the following domains:

\subsubsection*{Educational Environments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robotics laboratory exercises and embedded systems coursework.
    \item Training platforms for FSM design, voice interaction, and multimodal integration.
    \item Student projects in physical computing, AI, or human-machine interaction.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Research and Prototyping}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Human-aware robotics, embedded agents, and dialogue systems.
    \item On-device AI research in vision, audio, or reinforcement learning.
    \item Experimental deployments for multimodal user studies.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Personal Assistance and Home Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Local smart assistant for room-level interaction.
    \item Data logger and personal memory tool with offline NAS storage.
    \item Mobile assistant for intradomestic navigation and object detection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Interactive Installations and Public Spaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kiosks or assistive robots in museums, galleries, or libraries.
    \item Demonstrators for educational fairs, exhibitions, or science outreach.
    \item Emotion-aware installations for ambient feedback or guidance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Testbed for Advanced Control Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite State Machine experimentation and behavior graph validation.
    \item Real-time sensor fusion using voice, image, and environmental inputs.
    \item Controlled evaluation of system transitions under dynamic conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Privacy-Conscious Environments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use cases where no data should leave the local network.
    \item Offline interaction systems for children, patients, or vulnerable users.
    \item Regulatory environments (e.g., GDPR-restricted regions) where cloud-free operation is required.
\end{itemize}
